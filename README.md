## Getting Started
### CSS / Sass
These styles are created with Sass, using Gulp to concat to CSS. To reduce complexity, you will need to point the Gulp file to the correct project folders when switching between platforms.
You will need to change the paths for `return gulp.src` and `gulp.watch`.

### npm
To install all required packages, run `npm install`.
